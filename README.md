Watering System

Project Description: 
We recently started working on a garden that surrounds the perimeter of our backyard which would increase the
time spent on watering. The idea is from one hose we can split the water source into two paths that circle around
the perimeter of the yard and delivers water directly to all the flowers. Using freeRTOS and moisture sensors we
can automate this system.

Feature List:
- Moisture/Temperature readings
- Logging to external memory
- Wireless interfacing/manual override
- Solar power
